README for Baseball Weather Tracker

This is a web application that allows users to track the schedules of their favorite baseball teams and view their team logos. The app pulls information from two APIs - one for team logos and another for team schedules. The app does not yet have functioning weather forecasts, but this feature may be added in the future.

To get started with the app, simply navigate to the homepage and select your favorite team from the list of available teams. Once you've selected your team, you'll be taken to a page that displays the team's upcoming schedule. You can also view the team's logo on this page.

The app is called "Baseball Weather Tracker" and is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use tool for baseball fans who want to stay up-to-date on their team's schedule. The app is currently in development, so additional features may be added in the future.

If you encounter any issues while using the app or have suggestions for future features, please feel free to reach out to the developer. Thank you for using Baseball Weather Tracker!
